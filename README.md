# Data_analysis_projects

This is the final assigment for the coursera python data analysis project, were I used webscrapping to obtain stock data from the web and compiled it in a dataframe.
Then I built dashboards to visualize the changes in the revenue and close data over time. Please see theh notebook titled final_assigement_complete.

The other two projects are demonstrations for the use of certain classification and clustering machine learning models, particularly on datasets of stress and sleep related features for classification and spotify music data for clustering purposes. The datasets are obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets.

I hope you enjoy ;)
